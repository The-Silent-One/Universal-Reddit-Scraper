# Universal Reddit Scraper
Universal Reddit scraper using the Reddit API ([`PRAW`](https://pypi.org/project/praw/)).

Written in Python.

Based on the work of [Joseph Lai](https://github.com/JosephLai241/).

I cleaned some of the code and added extraction of comments since I needed it for my internship. It can take now a file as an console input.
Added an organizer to clean and remove duplicates
It still not finished but it does the work.

## List of future changes :

- merge the old code and the new.

- work around the error of extracting more comments then they are

- add a better exception handling

- remove sticky comments and posts from the extraction phase not the cleaning
